Important things to know


Before following the steps involved in creating an animated image, it's important to keep the below things in mind.


1.    The completed animated image must always be a .GIF image. .JPG or .JPEG images do not support animation.


2.    An animated image is comprised of multiple images. Each of these images must be the same size, in terms of width and height.


3.    The image should not exceed 256 colors.


4.    Internet browsers can be set to not display the animation for an animated image. 

 

5.    If disabled, the visitor would only see the starting frame and not all the frames that make up the animated image.
